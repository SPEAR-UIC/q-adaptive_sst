## Q-adaptive routing

The current master branch has the implementation of Q-adatpive routing in sst-elements/merlin Dragonfly topology.

Note: if you use this SST implementation, please cite the following paper:

Yao Kang, Xin Wang, and Zhiling Lan. "Q-adaptive: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Routing on Dragonfly Network". In Proceedings of the 30th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC â€™21).

### Installation 
1. Download sst-core and sst-elements from this repository, use other SST versions may cause compatible issue.  
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SPEAR-UIC/q-adaptive_sst.git
```

2. Follow [installation guide](http://sst-simulator.org/SSTPages/SSTBuildAndInstall10dot1dot0SeriesDetailedBuildInstructions/) to install SST.

### Run a test

```bash
mpirun -np 4 sst q-adaptive_sst/sst-elements/tests/dragonfly_q-adaptive.py 
```
