## Study of Workload Interference with Intelligent Routing on Dragonfly

The submodules of sst-core and sst-elements contain the toolkit enhancement for Dragonfly network interference study.

### Installation 
1. Download sst-core and sst-elements from this repository, use other SST versions may cause compatible issue.  
```bash
git clone -b df_interference_rl --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SPEAR-IIT/q-adaptive_sst.git
```

2. Follow [installation guide](http://sst-simulator.org/SSTPages/SSTBuildAndInstall_11dot1dot0_SeriesDetailedBuildInstructions/) to install SST.

### Run a test

check https://github.com/SPEAR-IIT/sst-elements/tree/df_interference_rl for a Cosmoflow and Uniform Random interference case study

### Docker container
The package under this repository provides a docker image with precompilied SST binary under */home/df_user/sst*
```bash
# pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/spear-iit/sst_q-adaptive:df_interference_rl

# create a work directory and launch the container
cd q-adaptive_sst
mkdir -m 777 wkdir
docker run -it --user df_user -v /path_to/wkdir:/home/df_user/mnt/wkdir,/path_to/q-adaptive_sst:/home/df_user/q-adaptive_sst \
    ghcr.io/spear-iit/sst_q-adaptive:df_interference_rl
```

### Network Analysis Workflow

The network interference analysis consists of three steps. 
For example, to investigate Cosmoflow network performance with Q-adaptive routing when it is the only job in the system:

```bash
# 1. Launch experiments 
q-adaptive_sst/scripts/run_sst_motif.sh pairwise --target cosmoflow --background null --rting q-adaptive 

# 2. Preprocess raw data
q-adaptive_sst/scripts/cat_csv.sh emberlog cosmoflow   # for app communication time
q-adaptive_sst/scritps/cat_csv.sh linkcontrol 0        # for app packet latency and throughput, 0--target app, 1--background app

# 3. Visualize result (Please consider update file path in the script accordingly)
python3 pairwise_app_latecy_bw.py 
python3 pairwise_app_comm_time.py
```
Folloing figure depicts Cosmoflow network throughput generated by *pairwise_app_comm_time.py*. 
Cosmoflow is featured by long computation time between allreduce network operation. 
Notice that in the figure, the time line does not start with 0 since the computation phase generate nearly no network traffic and two waves of allreduce operations are observed and separated by a computation phase between around 7ms to 12ms.
